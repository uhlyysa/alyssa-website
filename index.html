  <p class="paragraph">My name is Alyssa Mharie Arsenal. I was born on April 11, 2005 on Oahu, Hawaii. I am currently a senior in high school. My favorite activities include listening to music, shopping, and reading. Some of my favorite artists are TWICE and Beabadoobee. One Piece and Kimi Ni Todoke are my favorite animanga. I also love to hand sew and create mini handbags as well as making bead bracelets.

I enjoy hanging out with all my friends and family. </p>

<p class="paragraph">Here's a bunch of photos I took and edited when I took Photography 1 during my junior year in high school. In Photography 1, we learned how to use Adobe Photoshop and added filters, shapes, layers, etc to make our pictures stand out more. We also learned the many different angles and shots you can take, as well as the rules and principals.</p>

<p class="paragraph"> I also took Foundations of Construction during my junior year. We learned the basics of cutting as well as using different machines and tools to create wooden products. During the second quarter, we built a reindeer that can hold stuff Inside and in fourth quarter, we created a toolbox and painted both of them.</p>
